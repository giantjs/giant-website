Giant goes live at Mangahigh
----------------------------

*22 Sept 2015*

Giant went live at [Mangahigh](https://www.mangahigh.com) today.

This is a big deal for Giant, being the first occasion that it is used in a major (80kLOC) project as a *single framework* and not just as a set of semi-independent libraries. There's still a lot of work to be done until Giant reaches 1.0, but with this, it got a *lot* closer.

Big thanks to the team at Mangahigh for their support and feedback!
